- 👋 Hi, I’m @Collib29
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and agent based learning for biomedical and energy applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning and agent learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Biodynamo but open to other projects
- 📫 How to reach me by github account, can provide email by request

A set of experiments have been completed where gel, media composition, flow shear and centrifuge regimen have been optimised to improve bone cells (osteoblast) growth within a microfluidic hydrogelled bone-on-chip. The dataset that contains measurements of just excitation / lower light wavelengths from fluorescence in assay plate readers is  the ML_FlowCentrifuge.csv  file. The measurements that contain both excitation / lower light wavelenghts and emission / upper wavelenghts from the assay plate readers are contained in the ML_FlowCentrifuge_all.csv file.
